Rev My Ride
===========
An assignment I completed in the first half of 2016 originally in VisualBasic.NET and MS Access, re-made in HTML5 and JS. The original VB scripts and database are not provided as this may still be current.
This version makes use of IndexedDB to provide a database, rather than using a server-side script to access a database.

The original design brief is below:

Objective
---------
_Rev My Ride_ currently stores its customer details in a manual, paper-based
system. However, this system is inefficient, time-consuming, and easy to lose
track of.

They would like to move to an electronic system, which would be an
improvement upon their current system, more efficient and able to be customised
—should it need to— in the future.

This electronic system should allow the managers/servicemen in the company to
view, edit, delete, and print the customer detail records electronically.

Program Specifications
----------------------
### Programming Language
The program will be written in VisualBasic.NET, and the database backend will
be created in Microsoft Access.

### Input
The following details will need to be input into the program:
* Title
* Customer Name
* Address
* Home, Work, and Cell phone numbers
* Email Address
* Vehicle Make
* Vehicle Model
* Vehicle Registration No
* Type of work to be done
* Description of work to be done
* Whether the customer wants to receive promotional mail or not

### Program Features
The program will have the following features implemented:
* Add new records
* Edit record details
* Save record details
* Delete records
* Print a selected record
* Print all records
* Move to the next record
* Move to the previous record

### Output
The program will output to the screen, the database, and to a printer

### Constraints
The program will be constrained by the timeframe set by the client, and by my
knowledge and restrictions of the VisualBasic.NET programming language and
Microsoft Access Database Engine. It may also be constrained by the computer
resources I have access to and storage capacity.
